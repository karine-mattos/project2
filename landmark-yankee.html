            <h2>About</h2>
            <p><strong>Built:</strong> Originally opened in April 1923, the stadium became legendary for baseball
                milestones, World Series games, and other major events in American sports history. It served as the home
                field of the New York Yankees for generations and was known as "The House That Ruth Built" after Babe
                Ruth a famous Yankee player.</p>
            <p><strong>Today:</strong> The original stadium was replaced in 2009 by a new stadium of the same name that
                paid homage to the original in many of its design elements. The new 4,300 seat stadium mimics the old
                stadium both in the exterior design and the playing field while adding modern amenities.</p>
